# Automated-Brain-Stroke-Prediction-using-ML
This project develops an automated brain stroke prediction system using machine learning and XAI. It uses a Kaggle dataset, applies preprocessing like SMOTE and CHI2, and trains models including Random Forest and XGBoost. SHAP explains key features, while CatBoost and Stacking Classifier boost accuracy to 99%.
